# Vending Machine

## Description
This repository contains a Java program that mimics the use of a vending machine by collecting the number of sales and keeping track of inventory. A `Slot` object is defined for and has properties such as slot identifier, item name, item price, amount in inventory, and the amount sold. It also tracks the total number of slots and total earnings. 

## Breakdown & Usage
* There is the Slot.java Class (Data Definition Class) and the SlotImplementation.java Class (Implementation Class).
* It provides a menu-driven interface with options to add slots, empty slots, purchase items, display items, and exit the program, and includes validation for user inputs.

## How to Run
1. Compile both Slot.java and SlotImplementation.java.
2. Run the SlotImplementation class.
3. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the vending machine simulation.
